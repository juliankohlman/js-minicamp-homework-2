# Homework #2

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

	* `for` - A for loop will repeat the same action over and over, with a different value each time. Think about counting from 1 to 5. Each time you are adding 1 to the number but the number is different each time.
	* `&&`, `||`, `!` - The && symbol is a way finding out if two conditions are true. For example if it's the 25th of the month, *and* it's December then we know it's Christmas. The || symbol is a way of finding out if condition one *or* condition two is true. For example is 5 + 1 equal to 6 *or* 7? In this case the first condition with 6 is true. The ! symbol is placed to the left of a value, like *!this* and negates or reverses the boolean value. If you said that something is *not* true that means it's false, so !true means false. The reverse is true too. If something is *not* false then it is true or *!false* is true.
	* **Arrays** - An array holds a list of ordered items that are often related. A shopping list, or a list of books that you'll read at school could be placed into an array.
	* **Git** - Git keeps track of changes made to a computer file by taking snapshots of the files whenever a change is made. It's a way to manage different versions of the same files.
	* **GitHub** - GitHub is a website where you can load your git files. From there you can work, and interact with other people on those files while still keeping track of changes using git snapshots whenever a change is made.


2. Install git.  https://git-scm.com/downloads


3. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.

	* `git status`
	* `git add --all`
	* `git status`
	* `git commit -m "your commit message"`
	* `git push origin master`


4. Make the tests pass!
